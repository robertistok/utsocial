# utsocial

A management application connecting students and teachers of an educational institution. It has over 160 different components working together, including a chat, notifications, newsfeed, authentication, schedules, course overview, grades and attendance management. I did everything from zero, including the frontend, backend and design. It became a fairly complex application in the end.

Main technologies used for the project:
React, redux, mongoDB, expressJS, webpack, socket.io, mongoose, styled-components, heroku, ES6â€‹
